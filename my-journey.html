          After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, I've made the big jump over to the

          <div class="mini-title">How I stay committed to learning</div>
          <p>
            I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.
          </p>

          <div class="mini-title">How I got started</div>
          <p>
            I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.
          </p>
          <p>
            That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
